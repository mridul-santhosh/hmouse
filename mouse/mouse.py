#
# Run
#   sudo python3 mouse.py
#
# Connect from phone/tablet/PC to "HID" device
#
# Arrow keys move cursor. ESC stops server
# Button press  F1 = Left   F2 = Middle   F3 = Right
# Pg Up/Pg Dn  Increase/Decrease cursor step distance per key press
#
# This code sets an unchanging random address.
# If connection is unreliable try changing the address.
